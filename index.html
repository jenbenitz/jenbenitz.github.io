				<h2>EDUCATION</h2>
				<h3>PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY</h3>
				<em>2008-2012</em>
				<p>I earned my Bachelors Degree at Penn State University in <strong>May of 2012</strong> with a <strong>Major in English</strong> and a <strong>Minor in Psychology</strong>.</p>
				<p>As part of my English education, I learned a variety of writing and literature styles, including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Editorial Process;</li>
					<li>Technical writing;</li>
					<li>Biographical writing;</li>
					<li>Expository writing; and</li>
					<li>Nonfiction writing.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>As a student of the College of Liberal Arts, I had the freedom to shape my curriculum during my final two years, choosing to focus on writing and journalism.</p>
				<p>I chose to study Psychology to understand a person’s thought process and how people interact with each other. This has been especially useful in my journalistic work when interviewing people and analyzing situations.</p>
